/**
 A simple object-oriented wrapper for GCD semaphores. Removes the need
 to manage creation and disposal of `dispatch_semaphore_t` objects, and
 provides convenient methods that map to `dispatch_semaphore_wait()` and
 `dispatch_semaphore_signal()`.

 For example:

     EKSemaphore *sem = [[EKSemaphore alloc] init];

     // the default is to wait forever, until the semaphore becomes available
     [sem wait];
     // do some work
     [sem signal]; // signal that you're done

     // you can time out if the resource doesn't become available
     if ([sem waitForTimeInterval:1.0]) {
         // successful wait, do some work
     }
     else {
         // timed out after 1 second
     }
